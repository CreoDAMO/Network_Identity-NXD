## 💰 **Platform Revenue Distribution**
 
**Revenue Sources**:
 
 
- Domain registrations
 
- TLD creation fees
 
- API integrations
 
- Subscription plans
 
- Token utility-based services (e.g. Paymaster gas, partner APIs)
 

 
**Distribution of all platform revenue (100%)**:

**Founder/Developer**
 
20%
 
`0xCc380FD8bfbdF0c020de64075b86C84c2BB0AE79`
 
 
 
**NXD Liquidity Providers (LPs)**
 
50%
 
Sent to liquidity staking pool (or distributed pro-rata)
 
 
 
**NXD Ecosystem / DAO Treasury**
 
30%
 
Used for rewards, partner integrations, grants, growth ops
 
  
 
✅ **Every revenue dollar (or wei) is accounted for.** You can implement this in smart contract logic or via multisig-controlled treasury contracts.
  
## 🪙 **NXD Tokenomics Design**
 
Now let’s focus on the **NXD token** itself — covering its total supply, distribution, and function within your ecosystem.
  
### 🎯 Primary Token Objectives
 
 
- Power **subscriptions** and unlock premium features
 
- Back **governance**
 
- Reward **early adopters**, **LPs**, and **developers**
 
- Encourage **staking** and **long-term alignment**

Vesting
 
Recommended 4-year schedule with 1-year cliff (i.e., 25% after year 1, monthly thereafter)
 
 
 
Lock Method
 
Use on-chain vesting contract (e.g., Sablier, Superfluid, or custom vesting vault)
 
  
 
This builds trust with users, while giving the founder fair upside.
  
## 💧 NXD + LP Integration
 
The **50% platform fee reward** for LPs should go to a **staking or LP vault**. Here’s how you can design it:
 
### LP Pool Options:
 
  
 
Model
 
Details
 
   
 
**NXD/ETH LP on Base or Polygon**
 
Tradeable, incentivized via NXD or fee sharing
 
 
 
**Single-sided NXD staking**
 
For those who want to stake NXD only and earn platform rewards
 
 
 
**FeeVault smart contract**
 
Auto-distributes 50% of fees proportionally to LP token holders (like SushiSwap xSUSHI model)
 
  
 
LPs provide liquidity → earn revenue share (in ETH/USDC or NXD, depending on vault).
  
## 🧠 Optional: Dynamic Subscription Model
 
Let NXD also power **access to features** in a tiered model:
 
  
 
Tier
 
Requirement
 
Benefits
 
   
 
**Free**
 
Just wallet connection
 
Basic domain registration
 
 
 
**Pro**
 
Hold 10,000 NXD
 
Custom records, analytics, social graph
 
 
 
**Enterprise**
 
Stake 50,000 NXD
 
API access, gas sponsorship, team dashboard
 
  
 
Tokens can be:
 
 
- **Staked** to unlock features
 
- **Burned** for lifetime access
 
- **Transferred** for resale on secondary market

Don't forget White Labeling...


You're right — and **white labeling** is a major strategic pillar here, especially with the kind of modular, API-first Web3 platform you're building.
  
## ⚙️ White Labeling in the NXD Ecosystem
 
White labeling means giving third parties — devs, agencies, SaaS providers, or DAOs — the ability to launch their own branded version of your platform **using your infrastructure**, while you still retain monetization and governance control.
  
### 🔑 White Labeling Offers Massive Upside:
 
  
 
Benefit
 
Description
 
   
 
**Scalability**
 
Others can build without duplicating your infra
 
 
 
**Revenue Expansion**
 
Earn % from each white-labeled deployment (via NXD or fee split)
 
 
 
**Token Utility**
 
Partners must stake or hold NXD to access white-label APIs
 
 
 
**Brand Diversification**
 
Let niche verticals (gaming, DAOs, creators) create their own “domain registry”
 
 
 
**Network Effect**
 
More domain traffic, more users, more fees → more NXD burned/distributed
 
  
  
## 🧱 White Label Program Architecture
 
### 💼 Platform Architecture Layer (You Own This)
 
 
- Smart contracts (Registry, TLD factory, Paymaster)
 
- APIs (registration, record management, IPFS, etc.)
 
- UI modules or SDKs
 
- Subscription engine (NXD-based)
 
- Analytics backend (optional)
 

  
### 🤝 White Label Partner Layer (They Control)
 
  
 
Component
 
Provided by Partner
 
   
 
UI branding
 
Logo, custom domain, UX skin
 
 
 
Default TLD(s)
 
E.g. `.gam3`, `.dao`, `.club`
 
 
 
User onboarding
 
Wallet connect, auth, CRM
 
 
 
Additional features
 
NFT drops, referrals, integrations
 
  
  
## 🪙 Monetization Models for White Labeling
 
  
 
Model
 
Description
 
NXD Utility
 
   
 
**Access staking**
 
Partners stake NXD to unlock WL APIs
 
Lock NXD into vault
 
 
 
**Revenue share**
 
Take % of all fees from their deployment
 
10–30% back to core platform
 
 
 
**Subscription tiers**
 
Pay NXD monthly to unlock features (API limits, analytics, whitelabel support)
 
Burn or stream NXD
 
 
 
**Tokenized licensing**
 
Mint a WL license NFT with metadata (limits, permissions)
 
Buy/sell/license on-chain
 
  
 
 
✅ Combine: License NFTs + staking + revenue % = sustainable growth with token utility.
 
  
## 📦 Example: White Label Kit
 
Here’s what your **White Label Developer Kit** could include:
 
 
- **API keys & documentation**
 
- **Whitelabel frontend SDK** (React components for domain mgmt)
 
- **TLD creation guide**
 
- **NXD staking contract link**
 
- **Revenue dashboard** (fee tracking, user count, etc.)
 
- **NFT license mint UI** (optional)
 

  
## 🔐 Security & Control
 
To avoid abuse and enforce proper share routing:
 
  
 
Control Point
 
Solution
 
   
 
API abuse
 
Use API keys + NXD-based rate limits
 
 
 
Fee enforcement
 
Smart contract-level fee split (auto-send to core treasury + dev wallet)
 
 
 
Branding control
 
Restrict WL tier features by NFT or staking
 
 
 
IPFS abuse
 
Partner pins content via their own gateway or pay for yours
 
  
  
## 🧮 Updated Revenue Share Model (Including WL)
 
Let’s now reflect this in your **platform-wide fee architecture**:
 
  
 
Recipient
 
% of Platform Fees
 
Notes
 
   
 
Founder/Developer (`0xCc...`)
 
20%
 
Hardcoded
 
 
 
**NXD LPs**
 
40–50%
 
Depending on WL partner split
 
 
 
**White Label Partner**
 
0–20%
 
Configurable per partner license
 
 
 
**NXD Ecosystem Treasury**
 
Remaining %
 
Grants, growth, governance
 
  
 
 
WL partners can get 10–20% of the fees *they generate*, with the rest still flowing to LPs and core.
 
  
## 🔗 Suggested Flow
 `User (via WL platform)     ↓ Pays fee in ETH/USDC/NXD     ↓ Contract splits:  - 20% to founder wallet  - X% to LP reward vault  - Y% to WL partner wallet (if any)  - Remaining to DAO treasury `  
## ✅ Summary: White Labeling in NXD
 
 
- ⚙️ API-driven white label deployments allow partners to build on your infra
 
- 💰 Partners stake NXD or hold a license NFT to access APIs
 
- 🔄 Fee revenue is shared proportionally (you still control 100%)
 
- 🧠 Encourages external innovation, internal value accrual (more usage = more NXD needed)
